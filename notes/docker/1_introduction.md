### What is Docker?

-   Definition:

    -   Docker is an open-source platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
-   How It Works:

    -   Docker ensures that the application runs smoothly in any environment by packaging it into a container with its configuration and dependencies. This feature significantly reduces the "it works on my machine" problem.
-   Containers vs. Virtual Machines:

    -   Unlike a virtual machine, a Docker container doesn't need to replicate an entire guest operating system. Instead, the host's operating system can run multiple containers with various applications or services. This system is much more lightweight and uses fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.
