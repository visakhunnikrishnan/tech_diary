### Basics of Routing in Laravel 5.4

-   Basic Routing:
    -   Routing in Laravel is super easy. Routes are located in the `routes/web.php` file. Here's how you define a basic GET route to your page:

```
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

-   Passing Data:
    -   You can pass data to your views. Here's a simple dynamic route example:

```
Route::get('user/{id}', function ($id) {
    return 'User '.$id;
});
```

-   Available Router Methods:
    -   GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS
