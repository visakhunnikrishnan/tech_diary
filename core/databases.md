Overview of Databases
=====================

Databases are structured to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction with various data-processing operations. They are a critical part of modern software systems, and their efficient management requires an understanding of their structure, capabilities, and the various management systems that interact with them.

1\. Introduction to Databases
-----------------------------

A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Databases are used in several different applications, ranging from keeping records for businesses, collecting user data on websites, to usage in scientific research.

### Definitions

-   Data: Known facts that can be recorded and have an implicit meaning.
-   Database: Organized collection of related data.
-   Database Management System (DBMS): Software for managing databases. It provides an interface between the data and the software application.

2\. Database Management Systems (DBMS)
--------------------------------------

A DBMS is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data.

### Examples of DBMS

-   Oracle
-   MySQL
-   Microsoft SQL Server
-   PostgreSQL
-   MongoDB
-   SQLite
-   MariaDB

3\. Types of Databases
----------------------

Databases can be classified according to types of content: bibliographic, full-text, numeric, and images.

### Categories

-   Relational databases: Based on the relational model of data, these databases use a structure that allows users to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Commonly used in accounting and computing.
-   Document-oriented databases: Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data.
-   Graph databases: These use graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.
-   Key-value stores: The simplest form of databases, every single item in the database is stored as an attribute name (or "key"), together with its value.
-   Object-oriented databases: Information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming.

4\. SQL vs. NoSQL
-----------------

The language used to manage and manipulate databases is crucial in handling data effectively. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for relational database management and data manipulation. NoSQL databases are structured differently from traditional relational databases and can come in several types.

### SQL

-   Emphasizes strong consistency
-   Tables with rows and columns
-   Data integrity and normalization

### NoSQL

-   Built for specific data models with flexible schemas for building modern applications
-   Types: document, key-value, wide-column, and graph formats
-   Scalability and high performance

5\. Database Design
-------------------

Database design is the process of producing a detailed data model of a database. This data model contains all the needed logical and physical design choices and physical storage parameters needed to generate a design.

### Normalization

-   Process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency.

### Data Integrity

-   Measures and methods to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data over its life-cycle.

### ER Diagrams (Entity-Relationship)

-   Conceptual representation of data used to model the architecture of a system.

6\. Database Security
---------------------

Security concerns the protection of data against unauthorized access, alterations, or deletion.

### Access Controls

-   Mechanisms that control who can interact with the database.

### Data Encryption

-   Translating data into a secret code and back to secure sensitive information.

### Backup and Recovery

-   Strategies for making and storing copies of data to protect against data loss and system failures.

7\. Emerging Technologies and Trends
------------------------------------

-   In-Memory Databases: These databases reside in memory and are much faster than disk-optimized databases.
-   Database as a Service (DBaaS): Cloud services that offer companies a way to set up, operate, and scale databases without the need for hardware and other physical infrastructures.
-   Big Data: Technologies like Hadoop and others allow for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers.
