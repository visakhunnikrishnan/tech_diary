Overview of Machine Learning
============================

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This field is crucial in developing applications that are capable of performing complex tasks that, until recently, could only be performed by humans.

1\. Introduction to Machine Learning
------------------------------------

Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and perform predictive analysis on data. It is used in various fields and for multiple purposes, such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, statistical arbitrage, learning associations, classification, and prediction.

### Definitions

-   Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
-   Algorithm: A set of rules or instructions given to an AI, neural network, or other machines to help them learn on their own.
-   Data Set: A collection of data used in machine learning, typically to train and test algorithms.

2\. Types of Machine Learning
-----------------------------

Based on the nature of the learning "signal" or "feedback" available to a learning system, machine learning can be categorized as:

### Supervised Learning

-   Algorithms are trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known.
-   Example: A classification algorithm will learn to identify animals after being trained on a dataset of images that are properly labeled with the species of the animal.

### Unsupervised Learning

-   No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input.
-   Example: The algorithm could segment the data into clusters based on similarities which it has to infer without any prior training.

### Reinforcement Learning

-   A machine learning method that involves training an algorithm with a system of rewards and penalties.
-   Example: Used in various kinds of autonomous systems where the algorithm learns to perform a task by trying to maximize the reward from its actions.

3\. Common Algorithms
---------------------

Here are some standard algorithms that are essential in machine learning. Each one has its unique method of dealing with data and making predictions or decisions.

-   Linear Regression: A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
-   Logistic Regression: Used for prediction of the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic function.
-   Decision Tree: Uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.
-   Naive Bayes: A classification technique based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors.
-   k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A simple, intuitive and easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that looks at the 'k' closest labeled data points and assigns a label based on the majority class.
-   Support Vector Machine (SVM): A representation of examples as points in space that are mapped so that the examples of separate categories are divided by a clear gap.
-   Random Forest: An ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.

4\. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
-------------------------------------

-   Neural Networks: Computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They can learn to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.
-   Deep Learning: Part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
